    <p>This week I learned lots and lots of JavaScript.  I also learned how I learn best - for example, I need to drown out ambient sound and focus my concentration. 
        I enjoyed learning about loops and functions - but I'm still struggling a little bit to "put it all together" and whip out my own beautiful functional efficient code. 
        The best experience of the week for me, was when Matt came in and we all synced up on the very basics and we were reminded that it's okay if we don't understand everything 100% right now. 
        I have been getting frusterated when I don't grasp a concept as quickly as I'd like - but I am determined to have a bit of a more relaxed attitude and be more accepting of the learning process.
